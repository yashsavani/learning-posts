# Convex Geometry in High-Dimensional Spaces

## Introduction
- High dimensions are ubiquitous: even simple natural phenomena like leaf movements can be modeled in a high-dimensional space.
  
## Convexity Basics
- **Convex Sets**: Convex geometry provides an efficient way to handle high-dim problems.
Reminder: intersection of convex sets remains convex.
  
- **Convex Hull**: Denoted by $\text{conv}(T)$, it is the smallest convex set containing all points in $T$.
  - In 2D: line between two points; In 3D: simplex formed by three points.

## Representation Theory
- **Convex Combinations**: Any point $z \in \text{conv}(T)$ can be written as $z = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i z_i$, where $z_i \in T$, $\sum_{i \in [m]}\lambda_i = 1$, and $\lambda_i \geq 0$.
  - Coefficients are like probabilities, i.e., they sum to 1.

## Caratheodory’s Theorem
- **Parsimonious Representation**: At most $d+1$ points from $T$ are needed to represent any point in $\text{conv}(T)$ when the space is $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  - **Example**: Kyiv's location can be described as a convex combination of 3 other locations.

## Approximation and Dimensionality
The Approximate Caratheodory Theorem is a centerpiece in understanding dimensionality reduction and sparse representation in high dimensions.

### Probabilistic Methods
- **Empirical Method of Maurey**: Proves the approximation guarantees.
  - **Key Insight**: Treat convex coefficients as probabilities; use LLN for convergence.
  
- **Error Analysis**: The bound on approximation error can be as low as $\frac{\text{diam}(T)}{2k}$.

### Approximate Caratheodory Theorem
**Statement**: For any point $x$ in the convex hull of a set $T$, you can approximate $x$ using $k$ points $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$ from $T$ such that
$$|x - \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i| \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2k}}.$$
Importantly, $k$ is independent of the dimension, making it a dimension-free method.

### Why it Works: The Probabilistic Core
The underpinning of the Approximate Caratheodory theorem is essentially probabilistic:

1. **Convex Coefficients as Probabilities**: When you express $x$ as a convex combination, treat the coefficients $\lambda_i$ as probabilities.
  
2. **Random Variable Construction**: Construct a random variable $z$ that takes the value $z_i$ with probability $\lambda_i$.

3. **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**: By LLN, the sample mean $\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i$ will almost surely converge to $x$. The convergence rate is enhanced by the fact that we're dealing with bounded variables, allowing us to apply concentration inequalities to tightly bound our error.

4. **Error Bound**: Due to this probabilistic behavior, the error between $x$ and its approximation does not depend on the dimensionality but rather on the number of sampled points $k$.

So, the core idea is leveraging probability theory—specifically, laws of concentration—to escape the curse of dimensionality, allowing us to represent high-dimensional points using a finite and constant-sized set of basis points.

**Example**: Suppose you have a point in a 1000-dimensional convex hull formed by a massive point cloud. Using Approximate Caratheodory, you could feasibly approximate this point using just 50 points from the set, and the error would be bounded by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{100}}$, irrespective of the 1000-dimensionality.
